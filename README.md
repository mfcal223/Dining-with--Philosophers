Project's documentation - For code contact me to get access to the private repository

Check my notes to see the summary of this project, that includes a brief theoretical explanation of the most important concepts, 
and a summary on how I build the project. 
I have not used processes and sempahores. Therefore there will be amost no information about it. 

Finally, there is a checklist for self-evaluation created by my friend and collegue Maria Sofia Piantan, which she most generously share with me.
